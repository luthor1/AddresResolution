# Enhanced Address Resolution: A Hybrid "Coarse-to-Fine" Framework

## 🚀 Overview

This repository implements a sophisticated hybrid "coarse-to-fine" framework for high-performance Turkish address resolution, designed to tackle the challenge of resolving 10,390 unique address labels from noisy free-text data.

## 🎯 Methodology

### The "Coarse-to-Fine" Approach

Our framework decomposes the address resolution problem into two main components:

1. **Syntactic Normalization**: Cleaning and standardizing messy address strings
2. **Semantic Classification**: Mapping clean representations to correct address classes

### Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Technique | Objective |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| 1. Preprocessing | Turkish Text Normalization | Reduce noise and standardize text |
| 2. Feature Eng. | TF-IDF (Character n-grams) | Create robust features resistant to typos |
| 3. Baseline | k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) | Find most similar addresses quickly |
| 4. Fine-tuning | BERTurk Transformer | Use deep learning for fine-grained classification |

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Stage 1: Rigorous Text Preprocessing

The foundation of our approach is comprehensive Turkish text normalization:

```python
def normalize_address(text):
    # Lowercase and apply unidecode for Turkish characters
    text = unidecode(text.lower())
    
    # Expand common abbreviations
    text = re.sub(r'\bmah\.?\b', 'mahallesi', text)
    text = re.sub(r'\bsok\.?\b', 'sokak', text)
    text = re.sub(r'\bno\.?\b', 'numara', text)
    
    # Remove all punctuation
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)
    
    # Remove excess whitespace
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text).strip()
    
    return text
```

**Key Features:**
- Unicode normalization for Turkish characters (ş, ı, ğ → s, i, g)
- Comprehensive abbreviation expansion
- Robust punctuation and whitespace handling

### Stage 2: Feature Engineering with Character n-gram TF-IDF

We use character n-grams with TF-IDF weighting for robustness against spelling errors:

```python
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
    analyzer='char',
    ngram_range=(2, 5),
    max_features=25000,
    sublinear_tf=True  # Apply sublinear tf scaling
)
```

**Advantages:**
- Character n-grams are more robust to typos than word tokens
- Sublinear term frequency scaling prevents domination by frequent n-grams
- Configurable n-gram range balances specificity and feature space size

### Stage 3: Baseline k-NN with FAISS

A powerful baseline using cosine similarity and FAISS for fast search:

```python
# Build FAISS index for fast similarity search
index = faiss.IndexFlatIP(d)  # Inner product for cosine similarity
index.add(normalized_vectors)
```

**Benefits:**
- Direct modeling of address similarity
- FAISS enables fast approximate nearest neighbor search
- Cosine similarity captures semantic similarity effectively

### Stage 4: Advanced Clustering with HDBSCAN

Density-based clustering breaks the massive multi-class problem into manageable clusters:

```python
clusterer = HDBSCAN(
    min_cluster_size=20,
    min_samples=10,
    metric='cosine',
    cluster_selection_method='eom'
)
```

**Key Features:**
- No need to specify number of clusters
- Robust to noise with automatic noise point identification
- Creates natural, high-density clusters of similar addresses

### Stage 5: Fine-Grained Classification with BERTurk

Expert models for each cluster enable fine-grained classification:

```python
# Create expert model for each cluster
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    num_labels=len(cluster_labels)  # Much smaller than global 10,390
)
```

**Optimizations:**
- Mixed precision training (FP16) for speed and memory efficiency
- Gradient accumulation for effective larger batch sizes
- Early stopping and data augmentation

### Computational Efficiency
- **Character n-grams**: More robust than word tokens, reducing need for extensive preprocessing
- **HDBSCAN Clustering**: Breaks 10,390-class problem into manageable sub-problems
- **Expert Models**: Each cluster model only needs to distinguish between a small set of related labels

### Accuracy Improvements
- **Sublinear TF Scaling**: Prevents frequent n-grams from dominating feature vectors
- **Cosine Similarity**: Better captures semantic similarity than Euclidean distance
- **Cluster-Specific Training**: Models can focus on subtle differences within related address groups

## 🔍 Key Insights

### Competition Tips

1. **Character n-gram Range**: `(2, 5)` provides good balance between specificity and feature space size
2. **FAISS Index Type**: Use `IndexFlatIP` for cosine similarity, normalize vectors first
3. **HDBSCAN Parameters**: Start with `min_cluster_size=20, min_samples=10` and tune based on data
4. **Mixed Precision**: Use `torch.cuda.amp` for 2x speedup with minimal accuracy loss

### Hyperparameter Tuning

- **TF-IDF max_features**: 20,000-30,000 provides good coverage without memory issues
- **HDBSCAN min_cluster_size**: Larger values create fewer, more focused clusters
- **BERT learning rate**: 2e-5 works well for fine-tuning, use warmup for stability

## 📈 Expected Performance

Based on the methodological approach:

- **Baseline k-NN**: Should achieve 70-80% accuracy on similar address patterns
- **Clustering + Expert Models**: Expected to improve to 85-90% accuracy
